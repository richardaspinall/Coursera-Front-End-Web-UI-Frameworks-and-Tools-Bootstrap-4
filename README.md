While this was a good quick refresher course on Bootstrap, the main reason to do this was to have an anchor and use it as an example template for future personal projects. Not only in terms of documentation but goal setting. I set a goal of finishing this in the estimated time (4 weeks), I didn't rush ahead just to get it done. I allocated time after work and chipped away at the material.

## Results
### Soft skills
* I learned how to structure my learning and also test a framework for future learning
* Grading other's work â€“ while the course and assignment was very linear and simple, it did remind me that giving feedback and teaching is a super important part of learning.

### Hard skills
* HTML
* CSS & Bootstrap
* SASS & LESS
* JS & JQuery
